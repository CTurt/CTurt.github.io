				<h1>DS Custom Firmwares</h1>
				<hr>
				
				<p>
					Some time ago I experimented with making my own custom firmwares for the Nintendo DS.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The DS firmware is <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsfirmwareserialflashmemory">stored on a 256KB rewritable flash memory chip (NVRAM)</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					NVRAM can be <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsserialperipheralinterfacebusspi">rewritten via the SPI bus</a> on ARM 7, and in pages (256 byte chunks) only.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					libnds provides abstractions for writing to NVRAM (source/arm7/firmware.c), however, the <code>writeFirmwarePage</code> function is declared <code>static</code>, so you can't access it. You must either remove the <code>static</code> qualifier and recompile the library, or just copy the function to your project.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There is a small section at the end of the firmware which stores your username, birthday, WiFi settings, etc, that can be rewritten freely. However, the rest of the firmware (containing the ARM 7 and ARM 9 binaries, and additional data) is protected and can only be rewritten whilst the SL1 terminal is shorted.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h2>Getting code flashed to the firmware</h2>
				<p>
					If you have a hardware flasher like <a href="http://www.darkfader.net/ds/">darkfader</a> does, you can directly flash data to the NVRAM chip.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Since I didn't, I injected my custom firmwares into FlashMe, and used the modified installer to flash my firmwares for a while, but this was just a temporary solution.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I then updated <a href="https://home.comcast.net/~olimar/DS/">Olimar's</a> hbfirmware to be compatible with the latest versions of libnds and devkitARM instead. This <i>worked</i>, but was very messy code, and sound and text didn't work (so I had no idea when flashing was complete).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Finally, I wrote my own firmware flashing tool from scratch (<a href="https://github.com/CTurt/CFW-Suite/tree/master/fwManager">fwManager</a>). This tool allows you to store multiple firmwares on your flashcard under the <code>/firmwares</code> directory, and flash them easily (without having to recompile an installer).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I could now flash my own code to the firmware!

				<h2>Wireless controller CFW</h2>
				<p>
					Since I didn't think I'd be able to make anything better than the stock firmware, I went with a different approach, and tried to turn an old DS into a wireless gaming controller. The results are pleasing!

				<h2>Modifications to the original firmware</h2>
				<p>
					There is something deeply satisfying about adding some personalisation to your systems, even if it is just a minor text change (changing the carrier name of an iPhone for example).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					There are 5 sections to the official DS firmwares, which are concealed behind <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#dsfirmwareheader">compression and encryption</a>, and are verified with checksums.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					My main sources of code for extracting and injecting data from the firmware were <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12270">fwunpack by Chishm</a>, and <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=107106#107106">Lick's firmware tool</a>; which in turn, take code from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/">VisualBoyAdvance</a>, <a href="https://home.comcast.net/~olimar/DS/">hbmenu</a>, and probably others.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It was difficult to understand how most of it worked since they rely extensively on reverse engineered code (probably generated with <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/decompiler/">Hex-Rays Decompiler</a>).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In addition, most of the process is fairly cryptic anyway. Take a look at this for example:
				</p>
				
				<pre><code>r1=*(u16*)&firmware[0x14];
tmp=r1&7;
r0=*(u16*)&firmware[0x0c];
r0=r0*(4&lt;&lt;tmp);
tmp=(r1&gt;&gt;3)&amp;7;
r2=*(u16*)&amp;firmware[0x0e];
r2=0x2800000-r2*(4&lt;&lt;tmp);</code></pre>
				
				<p>
					Even after giving everything meaningful names, it is still somewhat confusing:
				</p>
				
				<pre><code>arm9romAddress = firmwareHeader-&gt;arm9romAddress * (4 &lt;&lt; (firmwareHeader-&gt;shift &amp; 7));
arm9ramAddress = 0x02800000 - (firmwareHeader-&gt;arm9ramAddress * (4 &lt;&lt; ((firmwareHeader-&gt;shift &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 7)));</code></pre>
				
				<p>	
					After clobbering together lots of code from lots of different places, I was eventually able to extract and inject data into the gui section (part 5) of the firmware. I open sourced it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/CFW-Suite/tree/master/guiTool">guiTool</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					From there, I modified the "Touch the Touch Screen to continue" text. Tested that my firmware worked with <a href="http://desmume.org/">DeSmuME</a>, and eventually flashed it to firmware of a real DS using fwManager.
